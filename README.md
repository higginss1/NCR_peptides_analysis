# NCR_peptides_analysis
R code and data inputs for Higgins et al. 2023. Plant-derived, nodule-specific cysteine rich peptides inhibit growth and psyllid acquisition of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’, the citrus Huanglongbing bacterium. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.18.545457 

# Download code and data

```{sh}
git clone https://github.com/higginss1/NCR_peptides_analysis.git

cd NCR_peptides_analysis
 
mkdir figures
```

You can now open the `NCR_peptides_analysis.R` file in Rstudio. All code is intended to be run as one giant file (run all) and should read in the necessary inputs from the cloned subdirectories and output figures to `NCR_peptide_analysis/figures/`.
